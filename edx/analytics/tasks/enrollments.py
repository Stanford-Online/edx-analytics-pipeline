    Determine which days a user was enrolled in a course given a stream of enrollment events.

    Produces a record for each date in which the user was enrolled in the course. Note that the user need not have been
    enrolled in the course for the entire day. These records will have the following format:

        datestamp (str): The date the user was enrolled in the course during.
        course_id (str): Identifies the course the user was enrolled in.
        user_id (int): Identifies the user that was enrolled in the course.
        enrolled_at_end (int): 1 if the user was still enrolled in the course at the end of the day.
        change_since_last_day (int): 1 if the user has changed to the enrolled state, -1 if the user has changed
            to the unenrolled state and 0 if the user's enrollment state hasn't changed.

    If the first event in the stream for a user in a course is an unenrollment event, that would indicate that the user
    was enrolled in the course before that moment in time. It is unknown, however, when the user enrolled in the course,
    so we conservatively omit records for the time before that unenrollment event even though it is likely they were
    enrolled in the course for some unknown amount of time before then. Enrollment counts for dates before the
    unenrollment event will be less than the actual value.

    If the last event for a user is an enrollment event, that would indicate that the user was still enrolled in the
    course at the end of the interval, so records are produced from that last enrollment event all the way to the end of
    the interval. If we miss an unenrollment event after this point, it will result in enrollment counts that are
    actually higher than the actual value.

    Both of the above paragraphs describe edge cases that account for the majority of the error that can be observed in
    the results of this analysis.

    Ranges of dates where the user is continuously enrolled will be represented as contiguous records with the first
    record indicating the change (new enrollment), and the last record indicating the unenrollment. It will look
    something like this::

        datestamp,enrolled_at_end,change_since_last_day
        2014-01-01,1,1
        2014-01-02,1,0
        2014-01-03,1,0
        2014-01-04,0,-1

    The above activity indicates that the user enrolled in the course on 2014-01-01 and unenrolled from the course on
    2014-01-04.

    If a user enrolls and unenrolls from a course on the same day, a record will appear that looks like this::

        datestamp,enrolled_at_end,change_since_last_day
        2014-01-01,0,0

    Args:
        course_id (str): Identifies the course the user was enrolled in.
        user_id (int): Identifies the user that was enrolled in the course.
        interval (luigi.date_interval.DateInterval): The interval of time in which these enrollment events took place.
        events (iterable): The enrollment events as produced by the map tasks. This is expected to be an iterable
            structure whose elements are tuples consisting of a timestamp and an event type.
